    def spoof_webgl_parameters():
        # Alter WebGL renderer and vendor information
        pass
    
    def manipulate_audio_context():
        # Modify audio processing fingerprint
        pass
    
    def dynamic_timezone_rotation():
        # Rotate timezone settings based on proxy location
        pass
```
